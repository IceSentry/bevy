Update (reproject + trace):
    History + Confidence per cascade -> A + Confidence
Merge 1:
    A3 + A2 -> B0
Merge 2:
    B0 + A1 -> B1
Merge 3:
    B1 + A0 -> spherical_harmonics

History: 4 cascades
A: Four cascades
Confidence buffer_0: R8Uint, four cascades
Confidence buffer_1: R8Uint, four cascades

* Consider the weighing functions used for merging/filtering/interpolating
    * Plane distance used in interpolating seems to do nothing right now
* Try some jitter:
    * Jitter rays per-cell + time
    * Use spatiotemporal blue noise for ray jitter
    * Jitter per-pixel offset into the interpolation for use with TAA?

* World cache improvements
    * Tie world cache to camera, use a log scale for cell size
    * Short trace distance
    * Reservoir sampling for the world cache update method
        * Light sources and other cache entries via choosing a random slice of world_cache_active_cell_indices
    * If visible last frame, reproject last frame's lighting
    * Think about hashing ray direction, instead of hit position
    * Variance driven world cache update rate, skipping very stable cells, and adapting to lighting changes faster
* Screen cache improvements
    * Consider 4x4 probes for the first cascade
    * More efficent/combined screen probe cascade reprojection/tracing/merging routines
    * 1/4th probe update rate

* Specular lighting
* Cleanup, remaining TODOs, performance profiling, documentation, etc
    * "A Fast and Robust Method for Avoiding Self-Intersection"
