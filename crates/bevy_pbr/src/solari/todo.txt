* World cache improvements
    * Tie world cache to camera, use a log scale for cell size
    * Short trace distance for sampling from other cells
    * Reservoir sampling for the world cache update method
        * Light sources and other cache entries via choosing a random slice of world_cache_active_cell_indices
    * Think about hashing ray direction, instead of hit position
    * If visible last frame, reproject last frame's lighting
* Screen cache interpolation weights
    * Use plane distance over depth weights?
    * Relax reprojection weights for higher cascades?
* Screen cache improvements
    * Deinterleaved layout for faster upper probe textupbre reads when merging?
    * Consider 4x4 probes for the first cascade
    * 1/2 or 1/4 checkerboard probe update rate
* Faster temporal reactivity

* Specular lighting
* Cleanup, remaining TODOs, performance profiling, documentation, etc
    * "A Fast and Robust Method for Avoiding Self-Intersection"

* SolariDirectIlluminationPlugin - ReSTIR for per-pixel direct light sampling
