* Consider the weighing functions used for merging/filtering/interpolating
    * Plane distance used in interpolating seems to do nothing right now
* Don't reproject final irradiance, reproject cascades instead
* Try some jitter:
    * Jitter rays per-cell + time
    * Use spatiotemporal blue noise for ray jitter
    * Jitter per-pixel offset into the interpolation for use with TAA?
* Spherical harmonics might still be broken?

* World cache improvements
    * Tie world cache to camera, use a log scale for cell size
    * Short trace distance
    * Reservoir sampling for the world cache update method
        * Light sources and other cache entries via choosing a random slice of world_cache_active_cell_indices
    * If visible last frame, reproject last frame's lighting
    * Think about hashing ray direction, instead of hit position
    * Variance driven world cache update rate, skipping very stable cells, and adapting to lighting changes faster
* Consider 4x4 probes for the first cascade
* More efficent screen probe cascade merging/tracing routines
* Count emissive from screen probe tracing hits?

* Specular lighting
* Cleanup, remaining TODOs, performance profiling, documentation, etc
    * "A Fast and Robust Method for Avoiding Self-Intersection"
    * Cull or simplify BLAS/TLAS entries for far away meshes
