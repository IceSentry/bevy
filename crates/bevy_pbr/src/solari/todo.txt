* Consider the weighing functions used for merging/filtering/interpolating
    * Plane distance used in interpolating seems to do nothing right now

* World cache improvements
    * Tie world cache to camera, use a log scale for cell size
    * Short trace distance
    * Reservoir sampling for the world cache update method
        * Light sources and other cache entries via choosing a random slice of world_cache_active_cell_indices
    * If visible last frame, reproject last frame's lighting
    * Think about hashing ray direction, instead of hit position
    * Variance driven world cache update rate, skipping very stable cells, and adapting to lighting changes faster
* Screen cache improvements
    * Jitter per-pixel offset into the interpolation for use with TAA?
    * Consider 4x4 probes for the first cascade
    * More efficent/combined screen probe cascade reprojection/tracing/merging routines
    * 1/4th probe update rate
* Faster temporal reactivity

* Specular lighting
* Cleanup, remaining TODOs, performance profiling, documentation, etc
    * "A Fast and Robust Method for Avoiding Self-Intersection"

* SolariDirectIlluminationPlugin - ReSTIR for per-pixel direct light sampling
